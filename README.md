# Analysis of Cal-Adapt downscaled projections

This repository contains tutorials showing examples of climate analytics applied to the Cal-Adapt data catalog. 

Contents are as follows:

1. Mapping Downscaled Products.ipynb: Explains the layout and contents of the Cal-Adapt catalog hosted by Amazon Web Services, as well as the basic principles behind the LOCA2 and WRF downscaling techniques used. Contains an illustrative example showing the differences between precipitation changes under LOCA2 and WRF

2. Mapping Multiple Variables.ipynb: Builds on tutorial 1 by adding vector information associated with atmospheric circulation

CodeAlong 1. Mapping Downscaled Products.ipynb: A partially completed version of tutorial 1, designed to facilitate interactive coding in a classroom environment
